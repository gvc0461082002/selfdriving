Since ROS Master and Clients can be installed into different computers,
Sensor data
     1. LIdar
     2. IMU
     3. Camera
 can be acquired by a mobile platform,
 the acquired data will be packed in the formate of certain msgs respectivelly, published over some topics
 
 The Computation-Intensive computer (usually Master) can subscrible such topics, analyzing the data carried by msgs, sending 
 feedbacks to client-ends.
 
 The clients receive data over topics (usually some commands, such as cmd_vel) to perform actions
