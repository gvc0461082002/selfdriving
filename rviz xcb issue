Qtcreator and rviz don't work because they require qt libs from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu but links with /usr/lib/libQt* instead (you can double check it using ldd $(which qtcreator) and ldd $(which rviz)). This mess indeed has lot to do with your camera package installation.

I see few ways to address this problem:

1. It looks like your linker prioritize /usr/lib over /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu. Check your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and if it contains a /usr/lib - try to get rid of it (you must track where you update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH - is it in .bashrc or somewhere else? maybe /etc/ld.so.conf.d?)

2. Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH in .bashrc to point a valid qt dir. Remember to not override the variable, but rather extend it (put that at the end of ~/.bashrc):

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
then reload the .bashrc:

. ~/.bashrc
In your experiments, you did an override when launching qtcreator and rviz so only one of these two apps was working depend on what LD_LIBRARY_PATH you set.

Alternatively, you can add /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ path in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ - just create a new .conf file with qt path and reload everything with

sudo ldconfig
Using this method will propably break your camera package because from now on it will link with libs from your new path.

3. Temporary move Qt libraries supplied with camera package (/usr/lib/libQt*) to another location and check if spinview works fine with other version of qt than 5.7. If yes - you are free to delete qt5.7 libs from /usr/lib/ as they are not needed - no sophisticated uninstall process is necessary here. You can always restore it with your camera .deb package anyway.
