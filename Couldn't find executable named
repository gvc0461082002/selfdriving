the proble happened in the robot_setup_tf, tutorial of tf from ros website
it works after replacement of CMakeLists.txt

the instruction from tutorial is:


Now that we've written our little example, we need to build it. Open up the CMakeLists.txt file that is autogenerated by roscreate-pkg and add the following lines to the bottom of the file.



add_executable(tf_broadcaster src/tf_broadcaster.cpp)
add_executable(tf_listener src/tf_listener.cpp)
target_link_libraries(tf_broadcaster ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
target_link_libraries(tf_listener ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

WHile the above one failed to fine executable nodes after catkin_make
instructions order should be issues
