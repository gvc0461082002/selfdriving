happened to remove simulator, then have to git it again, but the speed is slow in china
try to use proxy, but it doesn't function well, back to hosts-edit, catch the best cdn to git the simulator
test the release 2019.05 at ubuntu18.04 (plasma), crashed with segmentation fault

the problem was solved by sudo ./simluator not ./simulator

try sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop if sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop failed

Here two computers were used to test LGSVL simulator, one for the simulator and one for autoware

The simulator can be run after downloading the release version

It does take a long while to compile the autoware-on-lgsvl
1. install docker-ce, have to remove all previous docker before installation
2. install nvidia-docker, and related nvidia-graphic driver should also be installed to make the nvidia-docker function
3. ./build kinetic, did take a long while with lots of errors, the pop-ups are useful, errors are all resolved one by one
4. do need a high speed network, lots of git download
5. ./run kinetic ~/shared_dir,  to add sample data folder (shared_dir) into docker. otherwise, the autoware in the docker failed to
find sample data.
6. after run ./simulator, the bridge address is simply the server running lgsvl-autoware, no ports required
7. rosbridge is used to remap topics
8. the autoware does require high memory after start couple of lanuch files
9. for cross computer ros communication, still have to assign the ros-master-address explictely in the .bahsrc 
file. then source it.

Generally speaking, the installation guide is useful, but lots of errors happened during installation/compilation
