question 1: Robot moving sideways in RVIZ ROS
6

I have found the problem after some long search on the internet. The problem was that in Rviz, X-axis is defined as front of the robot and Y-axis is defined as the sideways. However, in my URDF I defined the robot in a way where Y-axis was its front and X-axis was its sideways. After fixing this, my robot moves normally in Rviz and Gazebo both.

 The commands are sent from the Jetson to an Arduino through serial communication. The Jetson simply processes the visual input from the camera and run a segmentation analysis. You can find out more about segmentation here.

If the segmentation shows that there is an object in the bottom of the view that is 20% size of the image, then the Jetson will send a stopping command to the Arduino.

3. test positional tracking

4. test spatial mapping

all 1-4 are c++ coding

1. compiling python api for python3
2. test several snippets in tutorials and examples

failed to image the whole system
locating IMU and SSD for jetson TX2
partially test ZED
20191011:
1. zed-tensorflow, tensorflow-gpu==1.15
2. nearly complete the test of ZED

20191012:
1. initialize Jetson TX2
2. must complete mirroring the ubuntu whole system
3. plan to flash tx2 with ubuntu18

Tx2 flash:
1. install jetpack,sdkmanager in the host machine
2. get to know all ip addresses including host and the jetson tx2
3. manual recover mode
4, mini usb connectkon between host and jetson
5. follow all steps
6. cuda installation into jetson is very slow.
7 installation of componennts is slow because some python packages installed via pypi

20191014
1. jetpack, sdk manager, hardware configuration, uncheck 'host machine'
2. opencv installation, opencv_extra_module path should be set correctly

2. yolov2, make file for different configuration
3.https://jkjung-avt.github.io/yolov3/
