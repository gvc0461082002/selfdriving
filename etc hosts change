Yes, really. The /etc/hosts file is just a map that links IPs to hostnames. If you want to be able to do things like ssh myname and have that run ssh localhost, you need to add a line that identifies localhost (127.0.0.1) as myname:

127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.0.1 myname

You could just replace localhost with myname, but then things like ssh localhost would fail and localhost is pretty standard. So just add another line as shown above.

THEN:
sudo ifconfig eth0 down
sudo ifconfig eth0 up
