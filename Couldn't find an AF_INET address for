skyhawk is right, set the ROS_IP for each computer. So for each computer, find the IP address in a terminal with

hostname -I

It will be the first set of numbers, like 10.0.0.25. To set it,

export ROS_IP=10.0.0.25

Make sure you're exporting the right address on each one, it'll be different for each computer.
