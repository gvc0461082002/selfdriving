sudo apt-get install libyaml-cpp-dev5v5

it's better to install the ubutnu default version as per potential conflict of (yaml-cpp github) with ros

for the requirements of libyaml-cpp.X version, we can build yaml-cpp source , simpley use generated static or so libs but not install them into system folder
